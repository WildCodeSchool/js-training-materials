Too Far:

Given a distance in KM, a time in minutes and an assumed walking speed of 1km/hour, calculate if a person can cover the distance in the given time.

Return true of false.

Tips:

Normalise data at the earliest opportunity.
Use unixtime!

Optional: Improve your code to support returning a third state, whereby the person can cover the distance if they run. Assume a running speed of 2km/hour.

Output should look like this:

2.5km and 40 minutes, the code should return false.
0.5km and 40 minutes, the code should return true.
