# GIFs dropdown

## Release / Update date
**05/02/2020**

## Description
This dojo is about manipulating the DOM using javascript. The user must be able to select an option in the dropdown and see the GIFs of that category on the page.

i.e.: if the user selects `cats` he/she sees only cat GIFs.

**DO NOT** edit `index.html` or `style.css`. **Work only on `index.js`**

## Requirements
- selecting a new value i the dropdown shows GIFs of that category only.
- when the page loads cat GIFs should be showing.
