# Dojos week 13

  
## Proposal #1 - Christmas App (Bdd/back/front)
#### Tuesday:


It is almost Christmas and Santa Claus is asking for an application so that children (name, first name, level of wisdom) can add gifts (name) to their list.
If a child is not wise, Santa Claus can delete these gifts. 

**Bonus**
> As Christmas approaches, the timings become tighter, he will soon start exploiting hundreds of elves (surname, first name). A leprechaun works alone on each gift and when he has finished he moves on to the next gift. Be careful you will probably have to add a todo/doing/done status to the gifts.

 1. BDD Modeling
 2. BDD creation _(You will manually add children/gifts/bonus-lutin in the database)_
 3. Node project initialization (express/mysql)
 4. Config MySQL
 5. Creation of express roads
	 1. Get a list of children with their gifts
	 2. Add a gift 
	 3. Delete a child's list
	 ** bonus**
	 4. Associate a leprechaun with a gift
	 5. Validate the manufacture of the gift (status gift table ok) 

  

#### Thursday:

 1. Initiate a react/angular project
 2. Connect the front to the back (fetch/httpClient)
 3. View the list of children and their gifts
 4. Button for deleting a child's list
 5. Form for adding gifts for a child
 ** bonus**
 6. View the pixie list
 7. Associate a leprechaun with a gift

  
## Proposal nÂ°2 - Dojo project (bdd/back/front)

  You now know your projects better than we do. 
  You normally have a valid bdd modeling, if it is not complete it is not given. 
  Concentrate this dojos on 2 or 3 tables linked by joints. 

> Ex: An e-commerce platform: users (name, first name, email) have a list of products (name, category, price) in their shopping cart.

 1. Database creation (Only selected tables) 
 2. Node project initialization (express/mysql) or use of resources provided by the trainer
 3. MySQL configuration
 4. Creation of express roads
	 **example**
	 1. Retrieve a user
	 2. Add / Update / Delete users
	 3. Add / Update / Delete products
	 4. View a list of products by category

  

#### Thursday:

 1. Initiate a react/angular project
 2. Connect the front to the back (fetch/httpClient)s
 3. Display a user
 4. Create a user creation form
 5. Reuse the creation form for the modification.
 ** bonus**
 7. Same for other roads
