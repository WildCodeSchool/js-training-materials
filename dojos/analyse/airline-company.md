# Airline Company

We want to manage flights operated by an airline company, without taking care of passenger seat reservations. Only one-week flights are considered. The company has a fleet of aircraft and a team of pilots, using which it operates a series of routes serving certain cities (more precisely: certain airports). It is assumed that flights are non-stop.  
Each aircraft is characterized by: a registration number, a type, a capacity (number of seats), a range (maximum distance that can be flown non-stop), a date of purchase and a date of last revision.
Some characteristics are common to all devices of the same type: this is the case of the manufacturer, the capacity and the range.  
Each pilot is characterized by an employee number, a name, an address, a salary, and a qualification that determines the types of aircraft he is authorized to fly.  
Each flight is identified by a unique number over the week and is characterized by a schedule, a route, a number of passengers, an aircraft, and a pilot (the captain).
