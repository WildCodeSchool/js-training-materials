# Airline Company

Our task is to manage flights operated by an airline company, not including the management of passenger seat reservations. Only one week of flights are to be considered for the task. The company has a fleet of aircraft and a team of pilots, which operate a series of routes involving specific cities (more precisely: specific airports). It is assumed that flights are all non-stop (direct).  
Each aircraft is characterised by a registration number, a type, a capacity (number of seats), a range (maximum distance that can be flown non-stop), a date of purchase and a date of last revision.
Some characteristics are common to all devices of the same type, such as the manufacturer, capacity and range.  
Each pilot is characterised by an employee number, name, address, salary, and qualification that determines the types of aircraft they are authorised to fly.  
Each flight is identified by a unique number over the week and is characterized by a schedule, route, number of passengers, aircraft, and a pilot (the captain).
