# Leisure centre

A leisure centre organises various activities throughout the year (climbing, snowshoeing, circus, knitting, acrobatic rock, etc.). We are interested in managing the participation of members in the various activities organized by the centre, in order to establish statistics on the practice of activities, and thus to better plan them and better know the population who practice them.

The information listed on the members is: an identification number, their name, address and age. For each member, we will also record the list of activity sessions in which they participate. The activities proposed in the centre's catalogue are referenced by name. For each activity, the unit cost of organizing a session per client is estimated, as well as the unit selling price to a client for attending a session.

It is assumed that, for a given activity, unit costs and prices are set independently of the sessions. For each activity session, we want to be able to find its dates and times of organization, as well as an evaluation score assigned individually by each client who has registered.
