# Leisure center

A leisure center organises various activities throughout the year i.e. climbing, snowshoeing, circus, knitting, acrobatic rock, etc. We are interested in managing the participation of members in the various activities organised by the center, in order to establish statistics on the practice of activities, and thus to better plan them and to analyse the population who practice them.

The information listed for each member is an identification number, their name, address and age. For each member, we will also record the list of activity sessions in which they participate. The activities proposed in the centers catalogue are referenced by name. For each activity, the unit cost of organising a session per client is estimated, as well as the unit selling price for a client attending the session.

It is assumed that, for a given activity, unit costs and prices are set independently of the sessions. For each activity session, we want to be able to find its dates and times of organisation, as well as an evaluation score assigned individually by each client who has registered.
