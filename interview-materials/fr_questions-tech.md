## Release / Update date

Original release: 12/09/2019

## Description

A quick Kahoot! to train our students apprehend some tech questions they could have during an interview.
Main goals:

- show them that even though they can _use_ a certain notion, it doesn't mean they can _explain_ it to a recruiter
- review some 'basic' knowledge they (should have) learned a few months ago
- diminish the shock of getting tech questions on an interview (the "brain-fart effect")

## Requirements

Medium: questions include some React questions, so it's too advanced for newbies ; it doesn't cover backend and databases for now and is centered around the React library.

## TODO

- Add some more advanced questions
- Add some questions about some other tools (Angular ?)
- Add some backend questions
